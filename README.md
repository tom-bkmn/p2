###Tom Beikman's P2 assigment for Dynamic Web Applications, CSCI E-15

• Live URL of the project:
 [p2.tombeikman.me](http://p2.tombeikman.me)
 
• Project description: The goal of this project is to create a password generator in the style of a XKCD password generator.  There are three controls on the page:

1. A text box to set the number of words to use in the password.  Each word in the password is separated by a hypen.


2. A checkbox to determine if a number should be appended to the password.


3. A checkbox to determine if the '@' character should be appended to the password.
 
• Demo information: I will perform a live demo of this project in section.  Section lead (Alain) will temporarily transfer control of the 
 WebEx session to me for the demo.
 
• Additional details:  One extra challenge is attempted.  Validation is supported on the text field so that only the integers zero through nine can be used as values.  Other characters produce an error.
 
• A bit of  third party resource was used from this site: 
    http://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000
    This is a 10,000 word list used as a pool of words by the password generator.  All 10,000 words are found in the mit.word.list.txt file in the source tree.
