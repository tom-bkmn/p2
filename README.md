 • Live URL of the project:
 [p2.tombeikman.me](http://p2.tombeikman.me)
 
 • Project description: The goal of this project is to create a password generator in the style of a XKCD password generator.  There are few
 interative elements on the page:
    a. A text box to set the number of words to use in the password.  Each word in the password is separated by a hypen.
    b. A checkbox to determine if a number should be appended to the password.
    c. A checkbox to determine if the '@' character should be appended to the password.
 
 • Demo information: No demo is needed for this project.
 
 • No additional details are needed.  The GitHub repository is public so no credentials are needed.
 
 • A little third party resource was used from this site: 
    http://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000
    This is the 10,000 word list used as the source of words for the password.  This list is found in the mit.word.list.txt file in the source tree.
